This is a basic HTML5 project to recap the basics of HTML and work on building a concrete understanding of working with Git and using commit messages to track progress.
By the end of this project i hope to have a good understanding of creating :
    . Filing system and file structure
    . Setting up HTML5 boiler plate
    . Adding Headings and the importance of heading hierarchy
    . Using Ordered and Unordered lists 
    . Adding image content to HTML pages
    . Creating paragraph tags with content between the opening and closing tags
    . Making regular commit messages and push to the projects remote repo
    . Publishing site to Git Hub pages
